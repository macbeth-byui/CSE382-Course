# Higher Order Functions - Fold and Unfold

The `fold` and `unfold` are also common higher order functions.  A `fold` will convert from a list to a single value whereas an `unfold` will convert from a single value to a list. 

## Fold

Just like the `map` and `filter` patterns, we will use a lambda function to define what we want to do with each item of the list.  Unlike the `map` and `filter`, we will not apply the lambda function to determine what to put in the resulting list.  Instead (in the case of `fold`) we will use the lambda function to determine how each item in our list contributes to the one single value result.  The lambda function is used to combine all the values in the list.

If I have a list of numbers `[1 2 3 4 5]` that I wanted to add, then a lambda function would take each number ($Value$) and add it to an accumulator ($Acc$):

:::: {.formulabox data-latex=""}
$spec ~ ~ \lambda :: real ~ ~ real \rightarrow real.$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ \lambda :: Value ~ ~ Acc \rightarrow Acc + Value.$
::::
$\nonumber$

If I wanted to add the squares of the numbers in the list, then I would want the lambda function to be 

:::: {.formulabox data-latex=""}
$spec ~ ~ \lambda :: real ~ ~ real \rightarrow real.$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ \lambda :: Value ~ ~ Acc \rightarrow Acc + (Value * Value).$
::::
$\nonumber$

The result of the lambda functions will be passed in as the accumulator value when we goto the next item in the list.  This implies that we will need to define what the initial accumulator value should be.

Notice that the `fold` function is expecting that the lambda to always have 2 input parameters where the second parameter is the accumulator.  The single output of the $\lambda$ function is the updated accumulator.

Here is the formal definition of the `fold`:

:::: {.formulabox data-latex=""}
$spec ~ ~ \lambda :: a_1 ~ ~ a_2 \rightarrow a_2.$

$spec ~ ~ \mathit{fold} ::  \lambda ~ ~ a_2 ~ ~ [a_1]\rightarrow a_2.$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ \mathit{fold} :: \lambda ~ ~ Acc ~ ~ []\rightarrow Acc;$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ \mathit{fold} :: \lambda ~ ~ Acc ~ ~ [First|Rest] \rightarrow (\mathit{fold} ~ ~ \lambda ~ ~ (\lambda ~ ~ First ~ ~ Acc) ~ ~ Rest).$
::::
$\nonumber$

Notice the recursive nature of the `fold` as it applies the lambda function to the each element one at a time starting with the first element ($First$).  The result of calling the lambda function ($\lambda ~ ~ First ~ ~ Acc$) becomes the new accumulator value when `fold` is called recursively on the remainder of the list ($Rest$).

Consider the code implementation below.

```erlang
fold(_Lambda, Acc, []) -> Acc;
fold(Lambda, Acc, [First|Rest]) -> fold(Lambda, Lambda(First, Acc), Rest).
```
The initial `Acc` passed to the `fold` function represents the initial value of the accumulator.  If we were summing up numbers in a list, we would expect the initial accumulator to be 0.

Note that Erlang provides this function as a built-in function called `lists:foldl` (meaning fold left).

**Problem Set 1**

You can find the template for the problem sets in this lesson here: [prove04.erl](proves/prove04.erl)

1. Implement the the `fold` code and use the lambda examples above to sum a list of numbers.  Test code is provided for you in the starting code.
2. Create a lambda function to use with your `fold` function to concatenate a list of strings.  Note that you can use the `++` operator to solve this problem.  Test code is provided for you in the starting code.
3. Create a lambda function to use with your `fold` function to count the number of items in a list.  Test code is provided for you in the starting code.
4. Create a lambda function to use with your `fold` function to reverse a list.  Note that the single result that a `fold` returns can be a list if the lambda function is written properly.  Test code is provided for you in the starting code.

## Fold Right

When you look at the definition of `fold` notice that the list is processed from left to right.  We can define a function that goes from right to left called `foldr`.  This function will require us to traverse to the end of the list before we can actually call the lambda function.  In some cases, folding right instead of folding left will result in different results.

:::: {.formulabox data-latex=""}
$spec ~ ~ \lambda :: a_1 ~ ~ a_2 \rightarrow a_2.$

$spec ~ ~ \mathit{foldr} :: \lambda ~ ~ a_2 ~ ~ [a_1]\rightarrow a_2.$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ \mathit{foldr} :: \lambda  ~ ~ Acc ~ ~ [] \rightarrow Acc;$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ \mathit{foldr} :: \lambda ~ ~ Acc ~ ~ [First|Rest]\rightarrow (\lambda ~ ~ First ~ ~ (\mathit{foldr} ~ ~ \lambda ~ ~ Acc ~ ~ Rest)).$
::::
$\nonumber$

The code implementation of our function in Erlang is left for an exercise below.  Erlang provides a built-in function called `lists:foldr` to perform this task.  

:::: {.problembox data-latex=""}
**Problem Set 2**

1. Implement `foldr` and test it with the concatenation of a list of strings.  Observe the different behavior with the right fold versus the left fold done previously.

## Unfold

The `fold` design pattern is used when you want to consolidate from one larger thing to a smaller thing such as a list to a single value.  If we want to go backwards, this is called an `unfold`.  Note that folding and unfolding are not inversely related.  For example, if I had a list of numbers `[2 5 3 1]` and I folded them up using a simple sum function, I would get `11`.  However, if started with `11` and worked backwards, I could get a possible solution such as `[7 1 3 0]` which is different from our original list.  

When we `unfold`, we are relying on some initial conditions to generate the next value for our list.

Suppose we wanted to generate a list repeated numbers.  The number to repeat we will call $Value$ and the number of repeated values we will call $Count$.  We want to `unfold` our initial conditions ($Value$ and $Count$) to obtain the list of numbers.  For example, if $Count$ is 4 and $Value$ is 6, then the `gensame` function should result in `[6 6 6 6]`.  Here is a definition for our `gensame` function:

:::: {.formulabox data-latex=""}
$spec ~ ~ gensame :: integer ~ ~ real \rightarrow [real].$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ gensame :: 0 ~ ~ Value \rightarrow [];$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ gensame :: Count ~ ~ Value \rightarrow [Value | (gensame ~ ~ (Count-1) ~ ~ Value)].$
::::
$\nonumber$

Here is the Erlang code for `gensame`:

```erlang
gensame(0, _Value) -> [];
gensame(Count, Value) -> [Value | gensame(Count-1, Value)].
```

We could modify this function to create an increasing sequence of numbers by including an initial value ($Init$) and step size ($Step$).  To accomplish this, we need to define a lambda function to calculate the next value.  We will use $Curr$ to represent the current value that started with $Init$ and was increased by $Step$.  

For example, if we wanted a list of 5 even numbers starting at 4, then $Count$ would be 5, $Init$ would be 4, and our lambda would be:

:::: {.formulabox data-latex=""}
$spec ~ ~ \lambda :: real \rightarrow real.$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ \lambda :: Curr \rightarrow Curr + 2.$
::::
$\nonumber$

The output of our `genincr` function would be `[4 6 8 10 12]`.

:::: {.formulabox data-latex=""}
$spec ~ ~ genincr :: integer ~ ~ real ~ ~ \lambda \rightarrow [real].$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ genincr :: 0 ~ ~ Curr ~ ~ \lambda \rightarrow [];$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ genincr :: Count ~ ~ Curr ~ ~ \lambda \rightarrow [Curr | (genincr ~ ~ (Count-1) ~ ~ (\lambda ~ ~ Curr) ~ ~  \lambda)].$
::::
$\nonumber$

Looking at these two examples, we can generalize our function.  Let's create a generic `unfold` function that works for more than just numbers.  

![](images/unfold.drawio.png)

This function does not exist in the Erlang library primarily because its not generic enough.  We could have other means to replace $Count$ or we can even create a stream (we will see those later in the course).  For our purposes, we will create a generic `unfold` function that uses $Count$ but has a generic $\lambda$ that works with any type.  The specification and definition is give below:

:::: {.formulabox data-latex=""}
$spec ~ ~ \lambda :: a \rightarrow a.$

$spec ~ ~ unfold :: integer ~ ~ a ~ ~ \lambda \rightarrow [a].$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ unfold :: 0 ~ ~ Curr ~ ~ \lambda \rightarrow [];$

$de\mathit{f} ~ ~ unfold :: Count ~ ~ Curr ~ ~ \lambda \rightarrow [Curr | (unfold ~ ~ (Count-1) ~ ~ (\lambda ~ ~ Curr) ~ ~ \lambda)].$
::::
$\nonumber$

The Erlang code for `unfold` is given below:

```erlang
unfold(0, _Curr, _Lambda) -> [];
unfold(Count, Curr, Lambda) -> [Curr|unfold(Count-1, Lambda(Curr), Lambda)].
```

:::: {.problembox data-latex=""}
**Problem Set 3**

1. Implement the `unfold` function as described above and use it to generate an arithmetic sequence of numbers starting at 5 and ending at 30 stepping by 5 (`[5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`).
2. Use the `unfold` function to generate an geometric sequence of six numbers starting at 1 with a factor of $1/2$ (`[1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125]`).
3. Write a function called `range` that takes in $Start$, $Size$, and $Step$ parameters (in that order) and returns a list of size $Size$ starting at $Start$, stepping by $Step$.  Your `range` function must use the `unfold` function.  For example, `range(3,5,4)` would return `[3, 7, 11, 15, 19]`.  You should assume that both $Size$ and $Step$ are positive integers greater than 0.
